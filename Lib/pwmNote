Each channel has clock B and SB (0 and 1)
This will be use for single channel
PWMCLK_PCLK*X* = 0; //Clock B for channel X
PWMCLK_PCLK*X* = 1; //Clock SB for channel X

Polarity of Channel *This is high at the beginning of the period*
PWMPOL_PPOL*X* = 1;  

Enable Channel 
PWME |= PWME_PWME*X*_MASK;
